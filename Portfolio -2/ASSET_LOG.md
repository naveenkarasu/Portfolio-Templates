- The Three.js scene uses procedural geometry (particles, wireframe shapes) instead of external models
- All fonts are loaded from Google Fonts CDN
- All icons are inline SVGs

## Future Considerations

If you need to copy assets from folio-2025 in the future:
1. Copy only the specific files needed
2. Update this log with the source and destination paths
3. Note the purpose of each copied asset
